UKWA Notebook Apps
==================

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks intended to be hosted as web applications via Voila.

They are for internal/staff use and depend on APIs that are not externally accessible.

Note that Voila does not automatically run-all-cells, but this can be forced by the notebook.
